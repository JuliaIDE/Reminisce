Reminisce
=========

Reminisce caches your tabs (including their content) so that you can close and reopen Light Table without losing your place.

Features:
 * Close and reopen LT without losing data
 * C-Shift-T to reopen the last closed tab, just like Chrome (but works even after a restart)
 * Preserves the content of "dirty" editors after restarting, but you can go back to the original file with C-Z.
 
Current Limitations:
 * Walks over editors rather than tabs themselves, so the order of tabs may not be preserved.
 * Tabsets are not supported.

In principle the system is also really generic â€“ once the above issues are fixed any kind of tab, not just editors, will be able to hook into it and preserve content.
